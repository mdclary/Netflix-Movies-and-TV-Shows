Introduction

Netflix uses Data Science to cater relevant and interesting recommendations for its users. I have analyized the option of a single algorithm that can be used to do the same.  We will first start assessing the Data Science option at Netflix with a basic introduction to Netflix:

Netflix is a streaming service that allows users to watch a vast array of TV shows, movies, documentaries, on internet-connected devices such as phones, tablets, laptops andtelevisions. As an added bonuswhile watching Netflix, you can enjoy unlimited ad and commercial-free viewing of Netflix content. There's always something diverse and interesting to watch and more content is added regularly! 

Streamed in over 190 countries, Netflix has an extensive global content libraryfeaturing award-winning Netflix originals, feature films, documentaries, TV shows, and more. Netflix content varies by region, and has the possibility to change over time. It is personalized by changing to your liking the more you watch.  Simply put, recommendations are based on a user's watching history. The more a user watches, Netflix gets smarter and becomes better at recommending what you like.   

While Iâ€™m certain that Netflix has a more robust machine learning process for their recommendation system, this repository is aimed at exploring the Cosine Similarity algorithm as a process possibility.
